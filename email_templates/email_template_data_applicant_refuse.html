    We wanted to let you know that, although your resume is competitive, our hiring team reviewed your application
    and <strong>did not select it for further consideration</strong>.
    <br><br>
    Please note that recruiting is hard, and we can make mistakes.<br>
    Do not hesitate to reply to this email if you think we made a mistake, or if you require more information about our decision.
    <br><br>
    We will, however, keep your resume on record and get in touch with you about future opportunities that may be a
    better fit for your skills and experience.
    <br><br>
    We wish you all the best in your job search and hope we
    will have the chance to consider you for another role
    in the future.
