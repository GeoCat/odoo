    Dear <t t-out="object.partner_id.name or 'customer'">Brandon Freeman</t>,

    <t t-if="ctx.get('payment_token')">
        Our final attempt to process a payment for your subscription using your payment method
        <t t-out="ctx.get('payment_token') or ''">TOKEN</t> failed.
        <t t-if="ctx.get('error')">
            <br>
            Your bank or credit institution gave the following details about the issue:
            <pre t-out="ctx['error'] or ''"></pre>
        </t>
        <br>
    </t>
    <t t-else="">
        Our final attempt to process a payment for your subscription failed because we have no payment method recorded for you,
        and we are unaware of any other payment efforts.
        <br>
    </t>
    <br>
    As your payment should have been made <t t-out="ctx.get('auto_close_limit') or ''">5</t> days ago, <strong>your subscription has been terminated</strong>.<br>
    If you wish to resolve this issue, or if you have made a payment recently, please contact us to resolve the issue.
