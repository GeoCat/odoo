This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-6387, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root due to a signal handler race condition in sshd.</p> <p>This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise, where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.</p> <p>Mitigation:</p> <p>The Ubuntu OS used in GeoCat Live or other GeoCat systems have been updated with the packages that the Linux distribution released before the disclosure. In addition SSH ports are not publicly open and can only be connected from certain IP addresses.</p> <p>Resolution:</p> <p>OpenSSH server and client where updated to versions that contain the patch to fix this vulnerability.</p> <p>Reference:</p> <p>CVE-2024-6387</p> <p>Qualys blog post</p>"}]}
